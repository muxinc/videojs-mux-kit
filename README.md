# Video.js + Mux Kit

The Video.js you know and love but optimized for using with Mux. The base is slimmed down a bit, then there are a few plugins included, namely Mux Data, and uses hls.js as the HLS playback engine. This is due to some issues we've seen with the default Video.js playback engine and Mux streams.

This project is now also set up to allow usage with Video.js's playback engine [VHS (Video.js HTTP Streaming)](https://github.com/videojs/http-streaming). See how to include that in your project below.

## Installation

```
// npm
npm install @mux/videojs-kit

// yarn
yarn add @mux/videojs-kit
```

If you don't use a package manager such as NPM, there are hosted versions provided by [unpkg.com](https://unpkg.com) too.

## Including videojs-mux-kit in your project

### Importing

If you use a package manager such as NPM, import the javascript and css in your application like this:

#### Default (hls.js)
```js
// include the video.js kit javascript and css
import videojs from '@mux/videojs-kit';
import '@mux/videojs-kit/dist/index.css';  
```

#### VHS
```js
// include the video.js kit javascript and css
import videojs from '@mux/videojs-kit/dist/index.vhs.js';
import '@mux/videojs-kit/dist/index.css';
```

### `<script>` tags

If you'd rather use the hosted versions, include this in your HTML page:

#### Default (hls.js)
```js
// script tags
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@mux/videojs-kit@0.8.0/dist/index.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@mux/videojs-kit@0.8.0/dist/index.css">
```

#### VHS
```js
// script tags
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@mux/videojs-kit@0.8.0/dist/index.vhs.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@mux/videojs-kit@0.8.0/dist/index.css">
```

## Usage

_In the below examples, replace the `src` attribute example to reflect the playback ID of your chosing._


Then, on your page include a `<video>` element where you want to add your player.

```html
<video
  id="mux-default"
  class="video-js vjs-16-9"
  controls
  preload="auto"
  width="100%"
  poster="https://image.mux.com/DS00Spx1CV902MCtPj5WknGlR102V5HFkDe/thumbnail.jpg"
  data-setup='{
    "timelineHoverPreviews": true,
    "plugins": {
      "mux": {
        "data": {
          "env_key": "ENV_KEY",
          "video_title": "My Great Video"
        }
      }
    }
  }'
>
  <source src="DS00Spx1CV902MCtPj5WknGlR102V5HFkDe" type="video/mux" />
</video>
```

Of course, you can also initialize all of this via JS as well:

```html
<video
  id="mux-default"
  class="video-js vjs-16-9"
  controls
  preload="auto"
  width="100%"
  poster="https://image.mux.com/DS00Spx1CV902MCtPj5WknGlR102V5HFkDe/thumbnail.jpg"
/>

<script type="text/javascript">
  const player = videojs('mux-default', {
    "timelineHoverPreviews": true,
    "plugins": {
      "mux": {
        "data": {
          "env_key": "ENV_KEY",
          "video_title": "My Great Video"
        }
      }
    }
  });

  player.src({ type: 'video/mux', src: 'DS00Spx1CV902MCtPj5WknGlR102V5HFkDe' });
</script>
```

## Demos

Also, the [demos](https://github.com/muxinc/videojs-mux-kit/tree/main/src/demo) are a great place to more references! In general, you can expect this to work almost exactly like Video.js + Mux Data with a few extra niceties. Mux streams can be specified by simply including the playback ID as the `src`, and `video/mux` as the type.

To run the demos, you can run `npm run dev` or `npm run dev:vhs` for running with VHS.
Once the dev server is running, open `http://localhost:8000/{file}` with `{file}` being one the demos like `basic.html` or `data.html`.
